# FHE AI Assistant 🔐

**AI Training Materials for Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) Smart Contract Development using Fhenix**

Train AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) on FHE development patterns using the Fhenix protocol to get expert-level guidance.

## 🚀 Quick Start (30 seconds)

### Essential File
```
Load this comprehensive reference into any AI:
📚 core.md (13KB) - Complete FHE library reference & patterns
```

### AI Platforms

**Claude Code:**
```bash
claude "Read the fhe-assistant/core.md file and help me build FHE smart contracts using these patterns"
```

**Other AIs (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.):**
Copy-paste the core.md file and say: *"This is FHE reference material. Help me build encrypted smart contracts."*

## 🎯 Proven AI Prompts

**Code Generation:**
- *"Build me a [voting/auction/gaming] contract using FHE patterns"*
- *"Create an encrypted token with private balances"*

**Code Review:**  
- *"Review this FHE contract against the security checklist"*
- *"Fix this contract that has FHE access control errors"*

**Learning:**
- *"Explain FHE access control and show me working examples"*
- *"Why can't I use ebool in if statements? Show me the right way"*

## 🔑 Key Success Formula

**Essential Mental Model:** *"Without FHE.allow() = passing a locked box without the key!"*

**Built for [Fhenix Protocol](https://www.fhenix.io/):** All patterns use `@fhenixprotocol/contracts` and target Fhenix networks.

1. **Load Core Patterns** → AI understands FHE fundamentals  
2. **Add Working Examples** → AI sees proper Fhenix implementation
3. **Ask Specific Questions** → AI applies patterns to your needs

**Result:** AI writes Fhenix-compatible FHE code following security best practices!

## 📁 What's Inside
